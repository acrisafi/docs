[Adjust](https://www.adjust.com) is a business intelligence platform for mobile app marketers, combining attribution for advertising sources with advanced analytics and store statistics.

## Supported Features

* All Adjust features are supported

## Prerequisites

Setup an account with Adjust at <https://www.adjust.com>.  If you will be forwarding custom app events, define the events in the Adjust dashboard to obtain the Adjust event tokens for mapping the events in mParticle to Adjust events.

## Data Processing Notes

* mParticle will only forward events to Adjust if:

  * iOS - An IDFA or IDFV is set
  * Android - A Google Advertising ID or Android ID is set
  * The data is less than 28 days old - <https://docs.adjust.com/en/event-tracking/#server-side-event-tracking>.

* If the incoming data includes an IP address, that address is forwarded alongside other device information.

* If you see excess 404 errors with Android devices, you may need to disable the input setting **Restrict Device ID by Limit Ad Tracking**.
* If you see 400 errors and you have both server-to-server and client forwarding, you may need to add a correct timestamp and a valid, known advertising ID (IDFA, IDFV for iOS or Google Advertising ID or Android ID for Android) to stop 400 errors caused by a race condition between the two types of forwarding.

## Adjust Kit Integration

mParticle's Adjust integration requires that you add the Adjust kit to your iOS or Android app, and the mParticle SDK will initialize and automatically map mParticle method calls directly onto Adjust method calls. This approach means that *every feature* of the Adjust SDKs are supported, as if the app had integrated Adjust directly. The source code for each kit is available if you would like to learn exactly how the method mapping occurs:

- [iOS](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-apple-integration-adjust)
- [Android](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-android-integration-adjust)

Add the Adjust Kit to your iOS or Android app. See the Cocoapods and Gradle examples below, and reference the [Apple SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk) and [Android SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-android-sdk) GitHub pages to read more about kits.
