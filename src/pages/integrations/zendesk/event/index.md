[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com) is a customer service platform. Itâ€™s designed for companies that want to create customer relationships that are more meaningful, personal, and productive.  The Zendesk event integration supplements customer support by providing them additional context about their users; allowing them to provide a more personalized experience.

## Prerequisites

The Zendesk integration uses the [Sunshine Events API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/sunshine/events_api#track-event-against-a-sunshine-profile) which is currently part of an [Early Access Program](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044235113) to track events against a Sunshine profile. You need to ensure your Sunshine plan is properly configured to use the integration by selecting Admin > Settings > Subscription at h<span>ttps://</span>**your-zendesk-subdomain**.zendesk.com/admin/billing/subscription.  

The following items are required:

1.  A [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com) Account.
2.  A Zendesk Sunshine Professional Plan or higher. 
    * Zendesk Sunshine Professional is the minimum required, but we recommend Enterprise or higher to avoid hitting Sunshine API limits. 
    * For more information check [Plan Availability](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/sunshine/introduction#plan-availability).
3.  Account Verification. 
    * See [verifying an end user's email address](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663786-Verifying-a-user-s-email-address) for more details.
4.  A Zendesk Sunshine [API token](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/support/introduction#api-token).

## Data Processing Notes

When you create a connection to Zendesk, forwarding for all existing data points will initially be set to *off*, and send new data points by default will be disabled. You must enable the specific data points that you wish to forward to Zendesk.

mParticle recommends working with your Zendesk account manager before forwarding all events to your Zendesk account in the event [Filter](/guides/platform-guide/data-filter/). This will ensure that you have a sufficient plan to handle the additional events - check [Zendesk rate limits](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/sunshine/introduction#rate-limits).

mParticle will only forward events to Zendesk if:

1.  An email address has been provided as identity in the event
2.  The payload is less than ~2 Kilobytes - [Event maximum payload](https://develop.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360034212634-Event-maximum-payload)
3.  If a commerce payload is greater than ~2  Kilobytes, it will be split into separate requests for each product.  The description property will contain information on the set it belongs to; e.g., 1 of N. Please see specific commerce event types to learn more.


## Enabling User Profiles And Events In Zendesk

After you have finished configuring the integration in mParticle, and began forwarding events to Zendesk, you have to enable which of these *user profiles* and events **that have already been forwarded** will be visible in the *customer context*. To do this please follow the instructions on how to [Add Sunshine user profiles and events to customer context in a ticket](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044235113)
