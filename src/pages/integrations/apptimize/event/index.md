Apptimize allows iOS and Android teams to make real-time updates to the native app experience and data-driven product decisions. Teams can A/B test user flows, control feature rollouts, make instant UI changes, and more.

## Supported Features

A/B Testing

## Prerequisites

In order to enable mParticleâ€™s integration with Apptimize, you will need your App Key which can be found on your Apptimize [settings](https://apptimize.com/admin/settings/apps) page. 

## Apptimize Kit Integration

mParticle's Apptimize integration requires that you add the Apptimize kit to your iOS or Android app, and the mParticle SDK will initialize and automatically map mParticle method calls directly onto Apptimize method calls. This approach means:

* Every feature of the Apptimize SDKs that is represented in the mParticle SDK is supported, as if the app had integrated Apptimize directly. 
* This kit-only integration solely supports client-side data forwarding.

The source code for each kit is available if you would like to learn how the method mapping occurs:

- [iOS](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-apple-integration-apptimize)
- [Android](https://github.com/mparticle-integrations/mparticle-android-integration-apptimize)

Add the Apptimize Kit to your iOS or Android app. For the Android kit, you must also add Aptimize's Maven repository to your `build.gradle`. See the following examples, and reference the [Apple SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk) and [Android SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-android-sdk) GitHub pages to read more about kits.
