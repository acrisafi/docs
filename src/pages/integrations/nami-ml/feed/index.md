[Nami ML](https://www.namiml.com/) helps you launch, grow and optimize your mobile appâ€™s revenue using an in-app purchase and subscription model. 

## Enable the Integration

1. Select the Nami ML integration from the directory and add the **Feed** integration. The Nami ML Feed supports "act as" functionality, which means it acts like an input from your iOS or Android app and is forwarded to partners as such. If you want to use the feed for both iOS and Android, you will need to create two configurations. When you select an 'act as' platform and name the configuration, you will receive an API key and secret. Save these for the next step.
2. Provide these credentials to your Nami ML Account Rep and inform them of which platform (if any) the credentials are intended for.
3. With your Nami ML Account Rep, determine which Nami ML identity type to map to mParticle's Customer ID to ensure your Nami ML data is connected to the right user profiles. Nami ML will also send `namiml_user_id` as a Partner Identity.
<!-- 2. In the Nami ML Control Center, enter your mParticle credentials. -->
<!-- 3. In the Nami ML Control Center, map the appropriate Nami ML identity type to mParticle's Customer ID identifier. Nami ML will also send namiml_user_id as a Partner Identity. -->

Please see [Nami ML's Documentation](https://docs.namiml.com/docs/mparticle) for more details.

## Supported Event Types

Full details on the events sent by Nami ML and the possible attributes within those events can be found below.

Nami ML will send the following events to mParticle as Custom Events of type `transaction`. 

| Event | Event Attributes | Description |
| ---|---|---|
| cancelled  | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The cancelled event is generated when the user takes an action that either cancels a subscription or shuts of an auto-renewing process for a subscription.  A cancellation does not result in the revocation of an entitlement and loss of access to your app's premium features, it just shuts off any future billing after the current bill term end.  See the expired event for when an entitlement is no longer active. |
| expired  | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The expired event occurs when a user's access to an entitlement should be revoked.  This may occur because they had previously cancelled, the subscription is not set up for auto-renewing payments, or the payment was never received due to a billing error. |
| in_grace_period  | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The grace period event occurs when billing for a purchase product has failed and the store platform is still actively trying to recover the payment. |
| paused  | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The paused event occurs when a user has decided to pause their subscription and it will automatically resume at a future date.  Android only. |
| purchased  | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The purchased event is generated when a purchase is made by a user that generates a new active entitlement.  Purchase events are produced the first time a user purchases and also on any subsequent purchase where the entitlement has lapsed and is no longer active.  A purchase made of a product sku that grants an entitlement that is already active will not generate a purchased event. |
| renewal_in_grace_period  | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The renewal in grace period event occurs when the store platform was successful in recovering payment while a user was in grace period. |
| renewed  | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The renewed event is produced each time a payment is processed on a subscription with an active entitlement after the initial purchase.  If there was a gap where the entitlement was not active then a new purchase will produce a purchased event instead of a renewed event. |
| resumed  | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The resumed event occurs when a subscription becomes active again after a pause.  Android only.  |
| trial_converted | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The trial_converted event occurs when a customer's free trial ends and they are billed for a paying subscription for the first time. This will occur at the same time as a renewed event. |
| trial_did_not_convert | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The trial_did_not_convert event occurs when a customer ends their free trial and does not continue on to a paying subscription. This will occur at the same time as a an expired event. |
| trial_started | `namiml_event_category`, `namiml_event_subcategory1`, `event_platform` | The trial_started event occurs when a customer begins a free trial. This will occur at the same time as a purchased event. |
