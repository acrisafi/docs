## Authorize the Integration
Log in to your TikTok Ads Manager platform with your advertiser account.

### Delete / Disconnect an audience
TikTok Ads Manager does not allow audiences used by ad groups to be deleted. Before deleting or disconnecting an audience in mParticle, check your TikTok Ads Manager Account to be sure there are no Ads associated with the audience.
