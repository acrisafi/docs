SimpleReach helps publishers, agencies and brands measure, intelligently distribute and retarget content across the most efficient channels to drive content ROI at scale.

## Supported Features

* Screen Views

## Prerequisites

In order to enable mParticle's integration with SimpleReach, you will need to work with your SimpleReach representative to obtain your SimpleReach Publisher ID for configuration.

## Event Data Mapping

Only ScreenView events are supported and the event must contain specific flags (Title, Date and URL) in order to be forwarded.  You can add these flags to your Screen View events or set up custom mappings based on your existing event data.  Custom Flags will take priority over custom mappings defined in the mParticle interface.

All of the required flags must be set in order for the event to be forwarded.  All other flags are optional and will be forwarded if provided.
